## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser, on the server-side. This Git reference documentation is designed to help learners navigate through the concepts discussed in the Node.js course videos. It summarizes key points, provides code snippets for practical application, and lists additional resources for further learning.

### Key Concepts

1. **Node.js Overview**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables running JavaScript code on the server-side.

2. **Core Features**:
   - Handling file uploads
   - Pagination
   - Working with SQL and NoSQL databases
   - Rendering dynamic HTML on the server
   - Building RESTful and GraphQL APIs
   - Real-time data handling with WebSockets

3. **Installation**: Download and install Node.js from the official website, nodejs.org.

4. **V8 Engine**: Node.js uses the V8 engine to compile JavaScript code to machine code.

5. **File System Access**: Node.js provides functionalities to interact with the file system, such as reading, writing, and deleting files.

6. **Server-Side Development**: Use Node.js to write server-side code for web applications, handling tasks like user authentication, data storage, and business logic.

### Code Snippets

#### Basic Console Log

```javascript
console.log('Hello from Node.js');
```

#### Writing to a File

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFileSync('hello.txt', 'Hello from Node.js');
```

### Installation Guide

1. Visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the latest version for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation prompts.
4. Verify installation by running `node -v` in your terminal or command prompt.

### Common Questions and Answers

- **Q: Can Node.js run on any machine?**
  - A: Yes, Node.js can be installed and run on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Q: What is the V8 engine?**
  - A: The V8 engine is Google's open-source JavaScript engine, used by browsers like Chrome and Node.js to compile JavaScript to machine code.

- **Q: How does Node.js handle file operations differently from browser JavaScript?**
  - A: Node.js can directly interact with the file system, allowing operations like reading, writing, and deleting files, which are not permitted in browser JavaScript due to security restrictions.

### Learning Strategies

- **Watch and Code**: Active participation by coding along with the videos, adjusting playback speed as needed.
- **Projects and Exercises**: Engage with provided exercises and projects to reinforce learning through practical application.
- **Resource Utilization**: Leverage attached source codes, external links, and course materials to solve problems independently.
- **Community Interaction**: Participate in the Q&A section to ask and answer questions, enhancing learning through community support.

## Practical Guidance

### Working with Node.js

- **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for Experimentation**: Use the Node.js REPL for immediate feedback when experimenting with code snippets.

```bash
node
> console.log(2 + 2);
```

- **Executing Node.js Files**: Develop applications in files for persistence, version control, and deployment.

```bash
node app.js
```

### Using Source Code Attachments

- **Before npm**: Run the main `.js` file directly with `node <filename>.js`.
- **After npm Introduction**: Execute `npm install` in the project directory, followed by `npm start` to run the application.
