## Module Introduction

- **Objective**: Understand the basics of Node.js and its role in web development.
- **Key Concepts**: Node.js for server-side scripting, handling requests and responses, asynchronous code, and the event loop.
- **Insight**: Node.js plays a crucial role in handling web requests and sending responses, utilizing non-blocking I/O and the event loop to efficiently manage tasks.

## How The Web Works

### Understanding the Web's Mechanism

- **Clients and Servers**: The web operates through interactions between clients (users) and servers (where websites are hosted).
- **Domain Names and IP Addresses**: URLs entered by users are translated to IP addresses through DNS lookup to connect to the correct server.
- **The Role of Node.js**: Node.js is used to write server-side code, handling incoming requests and generating responses, which could be HTML, JSON, XML, or files.
- **HTTP and HTTPS Protocols**: These protocols define the rules for data exchange between clients and servers. HTTPS includes SSL encryption for security.

### Practical Example: DNS Lookup

```javascript
// No direct Node.js code example for DNS lookup as it's a conceptual process handled by the network.
```

## Creating a Node Server

### Steps to Create a Node.js Server

1. **Initialize a Node.js File**: Typically named `app.js` or `server.js`, this file contains the server logic.
2. **Import Required Modules**: Use the `require` function to include Node.js core modules like `http` for server creation.
3. **Create the Server**: Utilize the `http.createServer()` method to define request handling and server response logic.
4. **Listen on a Port**: The `server.listen(port)` method keeps the server running to listen for incoming requests.

### Code Snippet: Basic Node.js Server

```javascript
// Importing the HTTP module
const http = require('http');

// Creating the server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(req); // Log the request object to understand its structure
  // Define response header
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  // Send a response to the client
  res.end('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>');
});

// Server listening on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

- **Insight**: This example demonstrates the basic structure of creating a server in Node.js, highlighting the event-driven architecture Node.js employs to handle web requests.

## FAQs

1. **What is Node.js used for?**
   - Node.js is used for writing server-side applications in JavaScript, enabling non-blocking I/O operations through its event-driven architecture.

2. **How does the DNS lookup process work?**
   - DNS lookup translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing browsers to connect to the servers where the websites are hosted.

3. **Can Node.js only serve HTML content?**
   - No, Node.js can serve various types of content, including HTML, JSON, XML, and files, by appropriately setting the response headers.
