## Module Introduction

- **Objective**: Understand the basics of Node.js and its role in web development.
- **Key Concepts**: Node.js for server-side scripting, handling requests and responses, asynchronous code, and the event loop.
- **Insight**: Node.js plays a crucial role in handling web requests and sending responses, utilizing non-blocking I/O and the event loop to efficiently manage tasks.

## How The Web Works

### Understanding the Web's Mechanism

- **Clients and Servers**: The web operates through interactions between clients (users) and servers (where websites are hosted).
- **Domain Names and IP Addresses**: URLs entered by users are translated to IP addresses through DNS lookup to connect to the correct server.
- **The Role of Node.js**: Node.js is used to write server-side code, handling incoming requests and generating responses, which could be HTML, JSON, XML, or files.
- **HTTP and HTTPS Protocols**: These protocols define the rules for data exchange between clients and servers. HTTPS includes SSL encryption for security.

### Practical Example: DNS Lookup

```javascript
// No direct Node.js code example for DNS lookup as it's a conceptual process handled by the network.
```

## Creating a Node Server

### Steps to Create a Node.js Server

1. **Initialize a Node.js File**: Typically named `app.js` or `server.js`, this file contains the server logic.
2. **Import Required Modules**: Use the `require` function to include Node.js core modules like `http` for server creation.
3. **Create the Server**: Utilize the `http.createServer()` method to define request handling and server response logic.
4. **Listen on a Port**: The `server.listen(port)` method keeps the server running to listen for incoming requests.

### Code Snippet: Basic Node.js Server

```javascript
// Importing the HTTP module
const http = require('http');

// Creating the server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(req); // Log the request object to understand its structure
  // Define response header
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  // Send a response to the client
  res.end('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>');
});

// Server listening on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

- **Insight**: This example demonstrates the basic structure of creating a server in Node.js, highlighting the event-driven architecture Node.js employs to handle web requests.

## FAQs

## The Node.js Lifecycle & Event Loop

Node.js operates on a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, primarily managed by the event loop. This loop enables Node.js to perform I/O operations asynchronously, allowing the server to handle multiple requests without waiting for tasks to complete.

### Key Points:

- **Event Loop**: Keeps the Node.js process running by executing callbacks as events occur.
- **Single Threaded Nature**: Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can handle concurrent operations through its event-driven architecture.
- **Process Continuation**: Node.js processes continue running as long as there are event listeners active.

### Example:

```javascript
// app.js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Handler for incoming requests
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

*In this example, the server listens for incoming requests indefinitely due to the event loop.*

---

## Controlling the Node.js Process

To manage a Node.js server process, understanding how to start, monitor, and gracefully exit the process is crucial.

### Starting and Stopping the Server:

- **Start a Server**: Execute `node app.js` in your terminal.
- **Stop a Server**: Press `CTRL + C` in the terminal where the server is running.

### Code Snippet:

```javascript
process.exit(); // Exits the Node.js process, stopping the server.
```

*Note: Direct use of `process.exit()` is uncommon as it immediately halts the server, making it inaccessible to users.*

---

## Understanding Requests

Handling HTTP requests is a fundamental part of server-side logic. The request object in Node.js contains detailed information about the client's request.

### Key Points:

- **Request Object**: Contains data such as URLs, headers, and methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Accessing Request Data**: Use properties like `req.url`, `req.method`, and `req.headers`.

### Example:

```javascript
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(req.url, req.method, req.headers);
}).listen(3000);
```

*This server logs the URL, method, and headers of each incoming request.*

---

## Sending Responses

Responding to HTTP requests is as crucial as handling them. The response object allows you to customize what is sent back to the client.

### Key Points:

- **Setting Response Headers**: Use `res.setHeader()` to inform the client about the response content type.
- **Writing Response Body**: Use `res.write()` to send content in parts or `res.end()` with content to conclude the response.

### Example:

```javascript
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  res.end('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>');
}).listen(3000);
```

*This server always sends a simple HTML response to any request.*

---

## Request & Response Headers

HTTP headers play a vital role in the HTTP request and response process, carrying metadata about the communication.

### Key Points:

- **Importance of Headers**: They carry information like content type, content length, and cookies.
- **Common Headers**: `Content-Type`, `Set-Cookie`, `Authorization`, etc.

### Resources for Further Reading:

- [MDN Web Docs on HTTP Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

### Example:

```javascript
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
```

*Sets the `Content-Type` header, indicating the body content is HTML.*

# Node.js Server Management: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to your go-to Git documentation for building and managing a Node.js server. This guide is meticulously crafted to enhance your understanding of Node.js, focusing on routing requests, managing HTTP request types, and handling file operations. Let's dive into the core concepts, illustrated with examples and best practices.

### Key Concepts:

- **Routing Requests**: Directing users to different parts of a web application based on the URL.
- **HTTP Request Types**: Understanding the difference between GET and POST requests.
- **File Operations**: Reading from and writing to files in a Node.js environment.

## Routing Requests

Routing is a fundamental aspect of web server management, allowing you to respond differently based on the requested URL.

### Handling GET Requests

- **GET Requests**: Used primarily to request data from a specific resource. By default, navigating to a URL in your browser sends a GET request.

#### Example: Responding to the Root URL

```javascript
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/') {
    // Serve an HTML form when the root URL is accessed
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
    res.end('<form action="/message" method="POST"><input type="text" name="message"><button type="submit">Send</button></form>');
  }
}).listen(3000);
```

*This code checks if the requested URL is the root (`/`) and responds with an HTML form.*

### Handling POST Requests

- **POST Requests**: Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.

#### Example: Creating a Route for POST Requests

```javascript
if (req.url === '/message' && req.method === 'POST') {
  // Logic to handle the POST request
}
```

*This snippet shows how to check for POST requests to the `/message` path.*

## Redirecting Requests

Redirecting users is essential for navigating a web application and managing server responses.

### Implementing Redirection

- **302 Redirect**: A common HTTP status code used for redirection.

#### Example: Redirecting after Handling a POST Request

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

if (req.url === '/message' && req.method === 'POST') {
  fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', 'Dummy text'); // Placeholder for incoming message handling
  res.writeHead(302, {'Location': '/'});
  res.end();
}
```

*This code writes a dummy text to `message.txt` and redirects the user to the root URL.*

## Working with the File System

Node.js provides the `fs` module for file operations, enabling you to read from and write to files on the server.

### Writing to a File

- **Synchronous File Writing**: The `fs.writeFileSync()` method blocks the process until the file is written.

#### Example: Writing User Input to a File

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', 'User input goes here');
```

*This example demonstrates writing a string to `message.txt`.*

### Reading from a File

- While not covered in the transcript, reading from a file is as crucial as writing to one. Here's a quick example:

#### Example: Reading User Input from a File

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const userInput = fs.readFileSync('message.txt', {encoding: 'utf8'});
console.log(userInput);
```

*This code reads content from `message.txt` and logs it to the console.*

## Conclusion and Further Learning
