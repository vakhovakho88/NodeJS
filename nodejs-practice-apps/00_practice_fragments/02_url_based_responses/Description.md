### Exercise 2: URL-based Responses
Extend the server you created in Exercise 1 (01_hello_world_server) . Modify it to return different responses based on the URL path. For instance:
- If a user visits `http://localhost:3000/`, the server should respond with "Welcome to the homepage."
- If a user visits `http://localhost:3000/about`, the server should respond with "Welcome to the about page."

**Key Concepts to Explore:**
- Request object, especially how to get the URL
- Conditional responses based on URL
